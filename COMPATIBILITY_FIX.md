# Model Compatibility Fix

## Issue

The application was encountering an error when loading the model on Render deployment:

```
ValueError: Unrecognized keyword arguments passed to DepthwiseConv2D: {'groups': 1}
```

This error occurs because the model was trained with an older version of TensorFlow/Keras, but is being loaded with a newer version where the `DepthwiseConv2D` layer implementation has changed and no longer accepts the `groups` parameter.

## Solution

A compatibility layer (`model_compatibility.py`) has been created to handle this version mismatch. This script:

1. Opens the H5 model file directly using h5py
2. Extracts and modifies the model configuration to remove the problematic `groups` parameter from `DepthwiseConv2D` layers
3. Creates a temporary model file with the fixed configuration
4. Loads the model from this temporary file
5. Cleans up the temporary file

## Implementation

The fix is implemented in two files:

1. `model_compatibility.py` - Contains the compatibility layer function `load_model_with_compatibility`
2. `Food_Classification.py` - Updated to use the compatibility layer instead of the standard model loader

## Usage

Instead of using the standard Keras model loader:

```python
from keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('Model.h5')
```

Use the compatibility layer:

```python
from model_compatibility import load_model_with_compatibility as load_model
model = load_model('Model.h5')
```

## Deployment Notes

- This fix should be compatible with both older and newer versions of TensorFlow/Keras
- The GPU-related warnings during startup are normal and can be ignored - they simply indicate that GPU acceleration is not available
- The fix does not require any changes to the model file itself, only to how it's loaded

## Future Considerations

For long-term maintenance, consider:

1. Retraining the model with the current version of TensorFlow/Keras
2. Saving the model in a more version-agnostic format like TensorFlow SavedModel
3. Pinning the TensorFlow and Keras versions in requirements.txt to match the versions used for training
